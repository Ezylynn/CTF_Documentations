# CTF_Documentations
## Purpose
This repository is a personal collection of my Capture the Flag (CTF) challenge write-ups
The goal is simple:
- Document solutions and thought processes for challenges I attempt
- Create a reference I can revisit later to reinforce concepts and techniques
- Show future employers that I know my shit :) 

## Structure
Each folder or file in this repo corresponds to a CTF challenge from an organization/club. Write-ups may include:
- Problem statement
- Step-by-step solution
- Commands, scripts, or screenshots used
- Key takeaways / lessons learned / regrets & contemplations of the amount of time spent on a single CTF

## Note
- This repo is for **educational and personal development purposes only**. I AM NOT trying to become a rogue hacker I swear, please don't deport me... 
- I'll explicitly mention if any of the write up contains spoilers, not because I like spoiling your fun, I'm just too lazy to blurred out the answers :)
